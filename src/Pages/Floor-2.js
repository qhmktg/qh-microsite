During the branding initiative of 2013-2014, interviews with those familiar with Quantum Health revealed that our care coordinators and nurses were thought of as more than mere advocates for our members — in many cases, they fought on behalf of members with the heart of warriors. Referring to our associates as Warriors empowers and reminds them to do whatever it takes to help during every member exchange."

But he faces a new normal: life in a wheelchair with painful survivor’s guilt. I connected with him three months after the crash. He shared that neighbors were taking turns carrying him in and out of the house because he and his wife didn’t have a wheelchair ramp. He was also trying to find someone to modify his car with hand controls so that he could drive. Helping him in every way possible became my mission. I set up therapy sessions, chased authorizations, outreached for medical supplies, assisted with claims, found a company to build him a wheelchair ramp, identified an organization to get him a mobility scooter and, most importantly, provided emotional support and resources to help him through feelings of depression and anger. " ,<strong> He is getting stronger every day and is in much better spirits. And I am proud to be by his side as he does.&rdquo;</strong> ]}
