I had gotten a letter from my company about Quantum, so I decided to call and see if they could help. I could not have been more pleased and surprised with the pleasant, professional, knowledgeable support I received from my Quantum Care Coordinator. He had all of the records at his fingertips. He sorted through the issues, confirmed current status and, to my amazement, proactively reached out to the various providers to coordinate a resolution. ", <strong> I was amazed! Thank you for an extraordinary experience. &rdquo;</strong>]}
