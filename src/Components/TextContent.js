            <p>Making this building feel like our home was a journey in itself. However, some things just fell into place like it was meant to be: five floors; five foundational pillars. Also, we brought some surprises over from Huntington Park to make it feel like home right away. These “Easter eggs” are nods to Quantum Health’s earlier years. Take a journey around the building to find all the surprises and get acquainted to your new home. </p>
            <p>At first, it may seem like you’ve been zapped into Oz, but that’s not (completely) it. There’s a backstory that begins during a 2013 branding workshop — a true one about member journeys and the brains, heart and courage it takes to guide those members through. It also involves armed bunnies.</p>
            <p>You are the heart and soul of this company. You are the reason we succeed. You are how we change the world. That’s why we’re building a destination where you can thrive. </p>
