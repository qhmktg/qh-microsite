Recovering from the accident has been hard, but you have not only found ways to help me and save money, you have brought joy to the journey. I loved the picture you sent of you and the other Warriors congratulating me on my final surgery. I will hang on to that! ‘Thank you’ really doesn’t cover how I feel about what you have done. You are making a difference in the world. Don’t ever forget that.</p>
